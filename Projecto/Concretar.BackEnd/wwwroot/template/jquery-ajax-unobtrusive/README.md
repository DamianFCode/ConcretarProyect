=============================

The jQuery Unobtrusive Ajax library complements jQuery Ajax methods by adding support for specifying options for HTML replacement via Ajax calls as HTML5 `data-*` elements.

This project is part of ASP.NET 5. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET 5 at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
